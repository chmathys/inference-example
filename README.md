# Bayesian Inference Example

This is the example I use in my introductory lecture to Bayesian inference, developed for UCL's twice-yearly [SPM Courses](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/).

We use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and its probabilistic programming language [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/).
